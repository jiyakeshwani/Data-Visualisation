üß† Technical Decisions & Trade-offs
Decision	Reasoning
Vite	Fast dev server & optimized build times
Redux Toolkit	Global syncing of variables & module state
Tailwind CSS	Rapid UI development with precision from Figma
Local Form State	Prevents partial updates until confirmed
Firebase Auth	Quick, secure setup with built-in OAuth options

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
No persistent backend (data lives in Redux store)

Minimal form validation

No unit/integration tests (low complexity due to dummy data)

Basic error/loading state handling

‚è±Ô∏è Time Spent
Task	Time Spent
Requirement gathering & understanding	1 hr
High-level data & user flow design	1 hr
Firebase Auth setup	1 hr
Redux & Types setup	30 min
Dashboard + Graph + Variable Panel	2 hrs
Slide-Over Edit Panel	1 hr
Edit Variable Form & State Syncing	1 hr
